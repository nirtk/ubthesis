# ubthesis

The files *thesis.tex* and *thesis.pdf* show a very simple example of using the *ubthesis.cls* style file.
The file *ubthesis.pdf* provides the original documentation.

The style file should be fairly well commented.
You'll need to read through the comments to make certain selections like department and degree.

Good luck!
